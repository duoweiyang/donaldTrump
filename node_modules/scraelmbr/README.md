# scraemblr
Scramble strings whilst retaining their readability. This is pointless.

## What is `scraemblr`?
A tiny module that scrambles text using the rules defined by [typoglycemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia).

> "_[Typoglycemia] purportedly demonstrates that readers can understand the meaning of words in a sentence even when the interior letters of each word are scrambled. As long as all the necessary letters are present, and the first and last letters remain the same, readers appear to have little trouble reading the text._"

## Sorry, what?
Like this:

> _Aowesme! It's a stnrage tihng but, as you can hoepulfly see, tihs is esaily rdeaalbe and yet appears srclmabed to hell. Terhe was ogirinally deabte taht the resarech came from Cmabrgdie Uinreivsty, though tihs turned out to be a wee bit of a lie. All the same, it's a cool pmhenoneon._

## How do I use it?
``` js
var scraemblr = require('scraemblr')

scraemblr('I\'d like to scramble this string please, sir.')
```

## What do I use it for?
I dunno.
